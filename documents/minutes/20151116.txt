question: how to get started with coding?
	can just have someone add the express code, commit to repository
	from there start working on authentication, models, etc. separately
mvp
	commenting on posts isn't an essential feature
	trending projects also keep out
think more about what we realistically can complete, and take out things that are non-essential
concepts need to be novel?
	not really too important
	just make sure concepts are actually concepts, e.g. asset not a concept
navigation bars
	not really pages
	alternatives
	if user is logged in can do things instead
		textual explanation maybe instead
		or enclose it all in box
		two boxes, one for guest pages and one for logged in pages
			can share some of the pages between the overlay boxes maybe
			sort of modularize by different screen, and inside a screen have several views
reset password rate limiting
	add a bit more description to that so it's more clear
	non-essential: don't need rate limiting necessarily
focus on threat model and those attacks
	don't just think about basic web applications
	e.g. recruiters make account on application to find people
	talk about how people use app and do bad things
design challenges: votes stored separately
	not really about performance, as long as fast enough
	just store as one way, and support count function in the model
	actual web applications might store as user+IP address set and also have separate count for display
	(data storage depends on what you think is important, e.g. if voting correctly very important then don’t have redundant structure, but if don’t care off the one and performance more important then store another way)
revised design
	try to address the issues with design, also look over it for other problems
	make any updates if our design has changed
following and favoriting
	follow user: user activity shows up on activity feed
	favorite project: show up on some bookmark-like set of projects
one owner per project
don’t need to submit new team plan, just discuss (but ofc do submit new design)
stuff to do in future
	agenda: set of topics we want to discuss
	report: summarizes the progress since last meeting
	we’ll create google doc to work on these things


(post-meeting meeting)
go with handlebars for templating
meet at 2:30 pm on Wednesday
kairat doing the skeleton
implementing votes
	project stores the set of users who have voted for it
	has functions for voting, checking whether given user has voted, and counting upvotes


who wants to fix what for the design document
Design challenges  - Eric
Concepts and data model - Kairat
	data model: mainly to change around favorite/follow
Security - Favyen
	e-mail addresses hidden by default
	moderate first couple project or first ten posts of newly registered users
	maybe eventually have functionality for administrators to delete troll posts and stuff
Transition diagram - George
