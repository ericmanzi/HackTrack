Peer reviews (MVP)
Team Hacktrack: George Ezenna, Kairat Ashim, Eric Manzi, Favyen Bastani

George
------

George designed the overall website theme and wrote initial static templates.
He implemented the templates effectively, making it straightforward to insert
dynamic content when server functionality was implemented. Eventually some
buttons can be improved to look more consistent across the application, but
the design was good for the MVP.

Kairat
------

In addition to implementing the project model and associated controller
functionality, Kairat also committed the initial application code. It was easy
to understand how the initial code worked, so that we could quickly get started
on implementing additional functionality. The project model unit tests need to
be written but it was fine for MVP. Some of the project model code still has
references to tweets from Fritter project, would be good to improve the
function specification, but again it was fine for MVP.

Eric
----

Eric implemented the user model for MVP, and has also been coordinating with
the rest of the team for deadlines for submitting various documents. He has
been very on top of things and communicating with team well. The user model
code for MVP was clean, well-documented, and well-tested.
