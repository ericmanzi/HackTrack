* Overall, the design of the project was pretty good.
* Discussions could be designed to look a bit better.
* Area to improve would be to start working on the task as early as possible, since there were some design/css problems near the deadline.

Eric
* Modal for logging in and registering is really good.
* Area to improve would be to more active in discussions of the features and implementation.

Favyen
* @mentioning in discussion was really well done.
* Make sure to notify the author of the model if you edited something.
* Area to improve would be communication, basically notify whenever there are some changes made in other people's code.
