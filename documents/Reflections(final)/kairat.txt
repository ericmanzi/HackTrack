Non-specific
* Probably should have abstracted loading new pages / loading new content, the resulting code to handle that was a bit messy, and it made it harder to deal with error responses (needed separate handlers for each error)
* Some last-minute issues came up like missing search bar, having code review system might help with this (but probably too much energy for small project)
* Some meetings and presentation times got moved / rescheduled last-minute, would be good to agree in advance on time / place
* Maintain some documentation on how we are doing modal transitions, links, etc.

George
* Overall, the design of the project was pretty good.
* Discussions could be designed to look a bit better.

Eric
* Modal for logging in and registering is really good.

Favyen
* @mentioning in discussion was really well done.
* Make sure to notify the author of the model if you edited something.
