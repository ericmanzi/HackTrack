Overall communication was good and there were only very minor issues with code quality.

Non-specific
* Probably should have abstracted loading new pages / loading new content, the resulting code to handle that was a bit messy, and it made it harder to deal with error responses (needed separate handlers for each error)
* Some last-minute issues came up like missing search bar, having code review system might help with this (but probably too much energy for small project)
* Some meetings and presentation times got moved / rescheduled last-minute, would be good to agree in advance on time / place
* Maintain some documentation on how we are doing modal transitions, links, etc.

George
* Good work on the design
* Resolve conflicts in merge commit instead of having additional commits

Eric
* Resolve conflicts in merge commit instead of having additional commits
* Avoid long "****** XYZ ******" comments in code; if code block is too long, should be moved out to a separate function, possibly in another module
* In mocha test, if multiple things need to be done asynchronously before the test, can have multiple before function (5280438e21a21f851f186ed044300beb7577e82d)

Kairat
* The tagging UI was very nice
* Would be good to start off with consistent code style across the application (IIRC project stuff started using tabs initially but we agreed on four spaces indentation)
* For design document, would have been better if data model was editable diagram instead of moving it to static image that only one team member has access to
