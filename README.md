HackTrack is a platform for MIT students to share projects they've worked on and get feedback from other students on these projects. 
The front-end is delivered to the browser by a server-side templating engine, Handlebars and is formatted by HTML, CSS and EJS. 
This app is supported by a Node/Express backend which is secured from cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgeries and other injections. 
Data is stored in a mongo database via the mongoose framework.
